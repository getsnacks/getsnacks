## Hi there 🙋🏽

I'm Seray, a passionate data scientist and bioinformatician with a background in evolutionary biology and population genetics. I specialize in data analysis and machine learning.
I enjoy applying machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems, whether through predictive modeling or in-depth exploratory analysis. My work is driven by a curiosity to understand the stories data can tell, and I’m constantly seeking new ways to make data more accessible and impactful.
